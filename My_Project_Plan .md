Of course. It's completely normal to feel baffled at this stage. We've moved from a simple POC to a much more ambitious MVP, and now is the perfect time to create a clear, prioritized, and detailed implementation plan.

As your CTO and senior partner, my goal is to give you that clarity. We will get the hard, foundational things done first, so that every subsequent step is easier and builds upon a solid base.

My Core Advice: The "Foundation First" Principle
Before we list the steps, it's important to understand our strategy. Think of our application like a building. We cannot start putting up walls and windows (the features) until we have a solid foundation (the database and user accounts). Our plan will follow this principle. We will build the core infrastructure first, then the main user workflow, and then layer on the "magic" features. This is the most efficient and robust way to build a real product.

Here is the detailed, prioritized implementation plan.
----------------------------------------------------------

The Pilot-Ready MVP: Implementation Plan

Phase 1: The Foundation – Database & User Authentication
Goal: Give our application a "memory" and the ability to know who is using it. This is the hardest and most critical phase. Everything else depends on it.

Step 1.1: Database Setup (Your Manual Task):
- Go to a provider like Supabase and create a new, free PostgreSQL database project.
- From the project settings, find and copy the Database Connection String.

Step 1.2: Backend Integration (Claude's Task):
- Update .env and requirements.txt: Add the new database connection string and the necessary Python libraries (sqlalchemy, psycopg[binary], sqlmodel).
- Create models.py: Create the database "blueprint" file, defining all the tables we'll need: Users, Classes, Sessions, and Topics.
- Update main.py: Add the core logic to connect to the database when the server starts.

Step 1.3: User Authentication API (Claude's Task):
- Create Endpoints: In main.py, build the basic API endpoints for:
    - POST /users/signup (for a new student or teacher to create an account).
    - POST /token (for an existing user to log in and get an access token).

Step 1.4: Frontend Login UI (Claude's Task):
- Build Components: Create the React components for a simple Login and Signup page.
- Implement Logic: Write the JavaScript to call the new backend endpoints and to save the user's login token in the browser.

Outcome of Phase 1: The application is no longer a single-user demo. It's a multi-user platform with a secure login system and a database ready to store data.
-------------------------------------------------

Phase 2: The Core Student Workflow – Impromptu Speaking & Progress Tracking
Goal: Implement the primary feature for a logged-in student, from recording a speech to seeing their saved progress.

Step 2.1: Save Session to Database (Claude's Task):
- Modify our main impromptu analysis endpoint (/api/analyze-chunked). It will now require a user to be logged in.
- After the AI analysis is complete, the function will save the entire feedback report to the sessions table in the database, linking it to the student's user ID.

Step 2.2: Build the Student "My Progress" Page (Claude's Task):
- Create a new page in the React app for logged-in students.
- This page will call a new backend endpoint (e.g., /api/me/sessions) to fetch a list of all the student's past practice sessions.
- It will display this history, allowing a student to click and view the feedback from any previous session.

Outcome of Phase 2: A student can log in, practice their speaking, and see a complete history of their work and improvement over time. The core value for the student is now live.
-----------------------------------------------------

Phase 3: The Teacher Workflow – Class & Topic Management
Goal: Build the essential tools for the teacher to manage their class and integrate the tool into their lesson plan.

Step 3.1: Build the Basic Teacher Portal (Claude's Task):
- Create a new, simple dashboard view in React that is only visible to users with a "teacher" role.
- This dashboard will show a list of students in their class.

Step 3.2: Topic Assignment (Claude's Task):
- In the Teacher Portal, add a simple form for the teacher to "Create a New Speaking Topic" for their class. This topic will be saved to the   topics table in the database.
- Update the Student Dashboard to display the topic assigned by their teacher, instead of a generic default.

Step 3.3: View Student Results (Claude's Task):
- In the Teacher Portal, make the list of students clickable.
- When a teacher clicks on a student's name, they will be taken to a view of that student's "My Progress" page, allowing them to review individual work.

Outcome of Phase 3: The tool is now a true teacher's assistant. Teachers can direct the practice and review their students' work, making it a fully integrated classroom tool.
-------------------------------------------------------
Phase 4: The "Magic" – Class Analytics & Curriculum Integration
Goal: Deliver the unique, high-value insights that make our product a "must-have" for schools.

Step 4.1: The Class Analytics Endpoint (Claude's Task):
- Create a new backend endpoint (e.g., /api/classes/{class_id}/summary).
- This endpoint will fetch all the recent session data for a class, feed it into the specialized "analytics" LLM prompt we designed, and return a summary of class-wide strengths and weaknesses.

Step 4.2: Curriculum Integration (Claude's Task):
- In the Teacher Portal, add the structured form for teachers to input their specific curriculum goals (Grammar Focus, Vocabulary Words, Custom Rubrics).
- Update the main analysis prompt to dynamically inject this information, making the AI's feedback hyper-relevant to the current lesson plan.

Step 4.3: Display the Summary (Claude's Task):
- Add a "View Class Report" button to the Teacher Portal that calls the new analytics endpoint and displays the summary and recommended tutorials. 

Outcome of Phase 4: The MVP is complete. The product is now a powerful, data-driven instructional tool that provides personalized feedback to students and actionable insights to teachers.



STEP 5:
Add back pronounuciation assessment next to IMpromptu. They removed the tab. 

POST MVP FEATURES TO LOOK INTO:

Post-MVP Task: Secure Batch Processing Jobs & Implement Ownership
What is this?
This task involves creating a clear link between a user and the long-running "batch processing" jobs they start.

Problem to Solve (The "Why"):
Currently, the batch analysis endpoints (/api/analyze-batch/...) are protected by a general login, but they don't check who started a specific job. This creates a minor security risk where one logged-in user could potentially guess the job_id of another user's job and access its status or results.

Action Plan (The "How-To"):

Update Database (models.py):

Create a new BatchJob table in the database.

This table will have two main fields: the job_id (from Azure) and the user_id of the person who started it.

Add a relationship from the User table to the new BatchJob table.

Update Backend (main.py):

Modify the /api/analyze-batch/start endpoint. When a new job is successfully started, save a record of the job_id and the current_user.id into our new BatchJob table.

Modify the /api/analyze-batch/status and /api/analyze-batch/results endpoints. Before fetching any information from Azure, first check our BatchJob table to ensure the current_user.id matches the user who originally created that job_id. If it doesn't match, return a "Not Found" or "Access Denied" error.

V2: 


Features that could be considered: 
Should the teacher also see a timer showing how long a student has been "in progress"? This could help them identify students who might be stuck or taking a very long time.
