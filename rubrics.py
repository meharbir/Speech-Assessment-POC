3.  Pronunciation: The AI will assess for largely correct pronunciation & clear articulation with very few intonation errors.
4.  Language (Vocabulary & Grammar): The AI will look for a wide range of appropriate vocabulary and a lack of grammatical errors. It will penalize the student for struggling to find appropriate words or having a limited vocabulary.
